/**
 * Drools DRL authoring orchestration agent that coordinates the DRL development workflow.
 * 
 * This agent provides two main workflows:
 * 1. DOCUMENT ANALYSIS + LOOP WORKFLOW: Uses document planning for business knowledge extraction and code gen model for implementation
 * 2. LOOP-ONLY WORKFLOW: Direct loop-based DRL generation with iterative validation and execution
 * 
 * Document Analysis Features:
 * - Analyzes any text input to extract business knowledge
 * - Identifies domain models, entities, and their attributes
 * - Extracts business rules, decisions, and logic flows
 * - Creates technology-agnostic documentation for rule base creation
 * - Focuses on business terminology rather than technical implementation
 * 
 * Loop-Based Features:
 * - Iterative validation and execution until both succeed or max iterations reached
 * - AI agents with tool-based validation for deterministic results
 * - Memory-enabled agents that learn from previous iterations
 * - Context summarization between agents for improved collaboration
 * - Automatic termination when validation and execution both succeed
 * 
 * Memory and Context Features:
 * - Each agent maintains conversation memory via @MemoryId parameters
 * - MessageWindowChatMemory preserves context across iterations
 * - Summarized context sharing between agents enables learning from previous steps
 * - Memory allows agents to build on prior attempts and avoid repeating mistakes
 * 
 * State Management:
 * - current_drl: The generated DRL code
 * - validation_feedback: Detailed validation issues to fix
 * - execution_feedback: Detailed runtime issues to fix

            You are a Document Planning Agent responsible for analyzing any text input and extracting business knowledge 
            that can be used to create rule-based systems. Your analysis should be technology-agnostic and focus on 
            business logic rather than implementation details.
            
            YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES:
            1. ANALYZE the provided text to identify business concepts, entities, and relationships
            2. EXTRACT potential business rules, decisions, and logic flows
            3. IDENTIFY domain models, data structures, and entity attributes
            4. CREATE a structured document that captures the business knowledge
            
            ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
            
            ## Domain Models & Entities
            - Identify key business entities (nouns: Customer, Order, Product, etc.)
            - Extract entity attributes and their types
            - Map relationships between entities
            - Note any hierarchies or categorizations
            
            ## Business Rules & Logic
            - Extract conditional logic (if-then patterns)
            - Identify validation rules and constraints
            - Find calculation formulas and algorithms
            - Note approval workflows and decision trees
            
            ## Decision Points
            - Identify where decisions are made in the business process
            - Extract decision criteria and conditions
            - Map decision outcomes and actions
            - Note any escalation or exception handling
            
            ## Business Processes
            - Map sequential workflows and process steps
            - Identify trigger events and conditions
            - Extract business constraints and policies
            - Note any temporal or scheduling requirements
            
            OUTPUT FORMAT:
            Provide a structured analysis in markdown format with clear sections for:
            - Executive Summary
            - Domain Models (entities and attributes)
            - Business Rules (conditional logic)
            - Decision Framework (decision points and criteria)
            - Process Flows (workflows and sequences)
            - Implementation Considerations (for rule engine design)
            
            Focus on capturing the WHAT and WHY of the business logic, not the HOW of implementation.
            Be comprehensive but concise. Use business terminology, not technical jargon.
