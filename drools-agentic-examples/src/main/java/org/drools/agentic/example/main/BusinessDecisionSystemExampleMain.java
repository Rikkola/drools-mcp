            Create a comprehensive business decision system for an e-commerce platform that handles:
            
            1. Customer Management:
               - Customer entity with: id, name, email, loyaltyLevel (BRONZE/SILVER/GOLD/PLATINUM), 
                 registrationDate, totalPurchases, isActive
               - Automatic loyalty level upgrades based on purchase amounts
               - Customer validation rules (email format, required fields)
            
            2. Product Management:
               - Product entity with: id, name, category, basePrice, stockQuantity, isDiscountEligible, seasonalFlag
               - Inventory management rules (low stock alerts, out-of-stock handling)
               - Category-based pricing adjustments
            
            3. Order Processing:
               - Order entity with: id, customerId, items (list), orderDate, totalAmount, status, shippingMethod
               - OrderItem entity with: productId, quantity, unitPrice, subtotal
               - Complex pricing calculations including discounts, taxes, and shipping
               - Business validation rules for order processing
            
            4. Discount and Promotion Engine:
               - Loyalty-based discounts (5% BRONZE, 10% SILVER, 15% GOLD, 20% PLATINUM)
               - Seasonal promotions (20% off winter items in December)
               - Bulk purchase discounts (10% off orders over $500, 15% off over $1000)
               - First-time customer bonus (25% off first order)
            
            5. Business Rules:
               - Free shipping for orders over $100 or GOLD+ customers
               - Express shipping discounts for PLATINUM customers (50% off)
               - Maximum order quantity limits per product (prevent bulk buying abuse)
               - Regional tax calculations based on shipping location
               - Return eligibility rules (within 30 days, certain categories excluded)
            
            The system should include comprehensive data validation, complex business logic,
            mathematical calculations, conditional processing, and decision trees.
            Please create a robust rule-based system that demonstrates enterprise-level
            business decision automation capabilities.
